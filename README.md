**The Life of a Government Clerk** is a single player, turn-based, coffee break Roguelike game made with Godot engine. The game title comes from Chekhov's short story, **The Death of a Government Clerk**, while the core mechanics are inspired by Kafka's novel, **The Castle**, in which K witnessed two clerks delivering document by cart in a hotel.

This game is similar to a truck simulator. Pull a line of Carts (from 3 Carts to as many as you can) and travel around the office zone. Deliver Raw Files and Documents to Clerks and Officers. You only need to send 4 Documents to beat the game. However, care must be taken to keep the file supply chain running. Besides, every time you move, your Carts collect Trash automatically. You lose the game if all the Carts are fully loaded with Trash. Use your wit and in-game help from Servants and Service Stations to finish the job. More Challenges await if you are an experienced Clerk.
